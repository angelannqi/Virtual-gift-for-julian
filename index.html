                        I don't know how you would react to this but I hope it's not too corny or overwhelming for you
                        Happy valentines day 👉👈 
                        <br><br>
                        Even though life can get busy and hectic at times but I appreciate my time with you, 
                        be it in person or through texts. Everytime I start overthinking, I'll start thinking back when you said, you do your thing, i do my thing and 6 months will pass just like that and I instantly feel better hahah.
                        So go and enjoy your time there and meet new people (or new crushes 👀), new things, hobbies and trips.
                         I'm always one call away if you need a cheerleader 💪🏻💪🏻
